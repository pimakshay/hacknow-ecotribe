**EcoTribe** is an innovative proof-of-concept developed for the "AI for less food wastage" challenge at the NTT DATA Business Solutions hackathon. It's an agentic AI framework that mimics human-like decision-making to assess fruit freshness from a single image, providing actionable insights for wholesalers and retailers to reduce food waste.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üì∏ Image-Based Analysis:** Simply upload a photo of a fruit to start the assessment.
-   **ü§ñ Agentic AI Workflow:** A multi-agent system collaborates to analyze different aspects of the fruit's quality.
-   **üî¨ Simulated Advanced Sensing:** Mimics hyperspectral imaging and gas detection to infer internal quality and ripeness.
-   **üìä Comprehensive Quality Report:** Get a detailed breakdown of fruit characteristics, defects, ripeness, and overall quality grade.
-   **üí° Actionable Recommendations:** Provides suggestions on shelf life, potential discounts, and sales strategy.
-   **üß© Explainable AI:** The step-by-step process provides transparency into how the final decision is reached.

## üß† The Agentic AI Framework

The core of EcoTribe is a sophisticated multi-agent workflow built with **LangGraph**. This approach breaks down the complex task of fruit quality assessment into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, each handled by a specialized AI agent. These agents work sequentially and in parallel, passing information through a shared state to build a comprehensive analysis.

### Workflow Diagram

The agents collaborate in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to process the data:

### The Agents

1.  **Image Analysis Agent:** Analyzes the visual properties of the fruit from the image, such as color, shape, and surface texture.
2.  **Hyperspectral Analysis Agent (Simulated):** Infers the internal condition of the fruit, detecting signs of spoilage that may not be visible to the naked eye.
3.  **Gas Detector Agent (Simulated):** Estimates the emission of gases like ethylene and CO2 to gauge the fruit's ripeness and metabolic activity.
4.  **Defect Assessment Agent:** Synthesizes information from the Image and Hyperspectral agents to identify specific defects like bruising, mold, or cracks.
5.  **Ripen Assessment Agent:** Combines gas and hyperspectral data to determine the exact stage of ripeness (e.g., fresh, partially-ripen, fully-ripen, spoiled).
6.  **Quality Assessment Agent:** Aggregates all prior analyses to classify the fruit into a standard quality grade (e.g., Extra Class, Class I, Class II, Below Standard).
7.  **Decision Support Agent:** A deterministic agent that translates the final quality grade into concrete business recommendations, including shelf life, discount percentage, and sales advice.
